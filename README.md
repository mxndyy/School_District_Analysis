# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the math and reading scores for the schools and the district without the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School due to the evidence of academic dishonesty. By removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School, this allows us to provide a more accurate picture of how students are performing at each school, district and type of school. 

## Results

  How is the school summary affected?

Thomas High School saw a slight decrease in their average math scores and math passing rate, from 93.27% to 93.19%, and even though their average reading score improved, the reading passing rate also saw a slight decrease, from 97.31% to 97.02%. These changes in their math and reading passing rates also led to their overall passing rate decreasing from 90.95% originally to 90.63% after removing their 9th grade class.
